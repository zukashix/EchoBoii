# EchoBoii

**WARNING:** This project has been abandoned for long. It may or may not function properly.
This was abandoned before being fully completed so it may have broken non-functional code.
The API Keys are all deleted from their respective API providers itself.


EchoBoii was my first ever "programming project". It was supposed to be a discord bot to provide useful utility functions
This is the 3rd rewritten version of the bot and the original source is not publicly available.

To run this bot, python 3.8 is recommended.
Install pip modules from requirements.txt and run like a normal python script
Or use Docker to run it.
